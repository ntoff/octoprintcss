# octoprintcss
css overrides for octoprint, more or less my own personal thing to change the colours of the navbar text to match my printer

To use the script, first get your octoprint version from the bottom of the octoprint page then add execute this script with that version. i.e. ./octoverride.sh 1.2.11.dev35+ge79703b

navbaroverride.sh is for the navbar temperature plugin
